# CV

Welcome to my first digital CV! As I had not that typical and straight career path you might expect, a classical version of my CV could look a little confusing. So i decided to create a CV where you can show and hide details. It allows you to first have an overview and if you like to know more, you can expand details to see my job positions and its companies. 

Like almost everything in life where nothing is perfect, this CV isn't, too. Things i need / like to refactor in future are:

- Changing CSS classes for the skills. Right now every skill has its own css lass which seems to be unnecessary.
- The HTML at some parts is inconsistent
- The page needs to be checked and refactored for accessibility reasons.
